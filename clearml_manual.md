# Fundamentals
- **Task** is your Python code, e.g., data processing, model training, etc.
    By default a task's type is set to *training*.
- **Queue** is a queue of your tasks
- **Agent (worker)** is the machine in which your tasks will be executed. One queue could be served by one or multiple agents.
